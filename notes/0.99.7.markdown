- added append and flatMap operation for inputs.
- added Sieve to set of examples
- implemented fold over selector. example:
```
  val fibbonachyGen = selector.afold{ case ((x,y),s) =>
       s match {
          case x:out.write => (y,x+y)
          case s:quit.read => CurrentFlowTermination.exit((x,y))
       }
  }
```
